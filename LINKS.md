HARDWARE:

https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/ -- main board (ESP32 Board) - general info - has wifi and is kute
https://github.com/espressif/esptool/issues/741 -- troubleshooting i had to take in account

(done) toadd - temperature and humidity sensors (DHT Unified Sensor) - i simply used the examples provided by the library it comes with

(done) toadd - air quality detector for ppm measurements (MQ135 Sensor)
https://blog.asksensors.com/air-quality-sensor-mq135-cloud-mqtt/ - reference for acieving a workaround for the MQ 135 Sensor

(done) -- pretty much, albeit the controller is finicky
https://www.mechatronicstore.cl/wp-content/uploads/datasheet-sensor-dsm501a.pdf -- dust sensor (DSM501A Sensor)
https://www.instructables.com/Dust-Sensor-With-DSM501a-and-ESP8266/ -- example of using the sensor that i ve tried to replicate

DATABASE CONTENDERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR:

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/quickstart.html -- i like this containarization
https://graphql.org/ - graphs dbs
https://www.gradio.app/ - another contender that was considered (somewhat, but not exactly what was needed)

FORGET THAT ; DO FIREBASE --> Flutter for android, ios, web --> IS WORKING (doing)
https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup --> AYYYYYY

SOME OTHER THINGS I VE SEEN:

https://github.com/expressjs/express
https://nodejs.org/en/download
https://www.npmjs.com/package/express

yeaa I won't be using those. Flutter and Firebase are better:]

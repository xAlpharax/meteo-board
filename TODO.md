integrate dht sensors (done, first thing done)
integrate mq sensor (done)
integrate dsm sensor (done) :DDDD

make an api interface (esp32 can use curl's and stuff) -- SORTOF -- arduino libs and functions are weird (for a first timer)

store the data on a mock server that can be accessed with requests (rest, crud) --> alphara.art ORRRR firebase:) --- firebase works (doing)

RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT A DISPLAY OF JSON IN MY APPLICATION (doing)

--- future - won t meet the deadline :( ---

somehow integrate that continuously with time series data forcasting and other AI/ML predictions -- need python for making AND condensing an ML model (future, quite possibly unattainable rn)
incorporate pretty graphs and predict future behaviour/forcasting of those data-points to show the urgency for measure-taking (also future..)

integrate dht sensors (done, first thing done)
integrate mq sensor (done)
integrate dsm sensor (done) :DDDD

make an api interface (esp32 can use curl's and stuff)

store the data on a mock server that can be accessed with requests (rest, crud) --> alphara.art ORRRR firebase:)

somehow integrate that continuously with time series data forcasting and other AI/ML predictions -- need python for making AND condensing an ML model

incorporate pretty graphs and predict future behaviour/forcasting of those data-points to show the urgency for measure-taking

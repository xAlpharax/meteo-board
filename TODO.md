integrate dsm sensor (doing)

make an api interface (esp32 can use curl's and stuff)

store the data on a mock server that can be accessed with requests (rest, crud)

somehow integrate that continuously with time series data forcasting and other AI/ML predictions

incorporate normal graphs and predicted future behaviour of those datapoints to show the urgency of measures that should be taken
